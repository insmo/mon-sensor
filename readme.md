Emil Renner Berthing's doordinio, power-meter, oniudra-headers where used to
learn and take all the good ideas from. Check out those projects for better and
more interesting code. My own branch of the oniudra-headers project is linked,
but that are mostly minor adjustments made to the original work to fit my needs.
